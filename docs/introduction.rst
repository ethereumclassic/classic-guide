Introduction
================================================================================

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is the most exciting technology today.  It promises to
upend governments, the financial industry, supply chain management and much
more.  The marriage of ETC with the Internet of Things is a game changer.  Some
think ETC may replace the World Wide Web!

ETC is composed of the world computer and database.  The ETC world computer is
also referred to as the ETC virtual machine.  The ETC world database is also
referred to as the ETC blockchain.  These two components have several noteworthy
properties:

censorship resistance
   It is virtually impossible to stop the execution of code or
   to deny access to information.

security
   Security is built in with cryptography.

pseudonymity
   Users are anonymous except for pseudonyms.

openness
   All the software is open source, and, all the activity for all time
   is available for inspection.

reliability
   It is always available and virtually impossible to shut down.

trustlessness
   There is no need to rely on any single person or entity.

All of these properties, except trustlessness, are possible without blockchain
technology.  For example, consider a web server securely configured with several
identical backup servers geographically distributed.  Suppose these web servers
were only accessible using `onion routing
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing>`_.  This setup can provide
significant censorship resistance, security, pseudonymity, openness and
reliability.  Note however how much effort is required.  With ETC, these
properties are present by default!

Because ETC is trustless, *no one* has special powers.  Therefore, it
is possible to implement extremely sensitive applications on ETC such as
financial and identity services.

Final note, everyone *effectively* runs their applications on the same single
computer, the ETC world computer.  However, this *virtual* computer is actually
implemented by a worldwide network of computers.  All the computers in the
network run all applications in parallel.  This extreme redundancy is a main
reason the ETC world computer has its amazing properties.
