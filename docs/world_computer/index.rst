World Computer (Virtual Machine)
================================================================================

The world computer is a single virtual machine implemented by a worldwide
network of computers.  Programs on the world computer are referred to as
:ref:`smart contracts <ch_smart_contracts>`.  Because the world computer is
`Turing complete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness>`_,
smart contract can be arbitrarily complex.  Users interact with the world
computer through :ref:`clients <ch_clients>` using
:ref:`accounts <ch_accounts>`.  In fact, *all* actions on the world computer are
initiated by :ref:`transactions <ch_trans>` sent from users.
